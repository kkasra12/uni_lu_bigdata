We implemented the same logic coded in scala which is available in the scala directory
for the scalability, we can see the output in the `report.png` file.
As we can see they are performing linearly but with a slope smaller than 1. 
This is because the overhead of the communication between the processes is not negligible.
The communication overhead is the time taken to send the data from one process to another.

to run the codes, there is a script called `run__scala_code.sh` that will run the code.
