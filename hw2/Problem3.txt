We can see in the outputs of the code the mean before changing the null values is __ and after setting the null values to 23 the mean is __.
So, only the rows with __<age<__ are considered in the new output which are __ rows.

# (D)
The survival age average is 28.34 and the average age of the died passengers is 30.63, which has no big difference. 
And it's somehow logical because we know they board the rescue boats with younger people first!
